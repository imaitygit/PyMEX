## PyMEX: Python package for Moir√© EXciton calculations

* Files in [src](./src)
1. `pymex.inp`: Input file\\ 
   `pymex_detailed.inp`: All the input files are exaplined in details.

2. `read_inp.py`: Reads and prints input files

3. `wan90tobse.py`: Conversion of Wannier90 outputs to PYMEX code.
4. `potential.py`: Real-space electron-hole interactions (and Fourier
                 Transforms etc.)
5. `dft2bse.py`: DFT output to PYMEX conversion
               (BandLines are used in SIESTA)
               QE is also supported.
6. `function.pxd`: External calls for cython 
                 Helpful for High-Performance-Machine arch.
7. `generic_func.py`: A few generic functions.
8. `cyfunc.pyx`: Most expensive for loops are cythonized for speed.
9. `constants.py`: Some constants
10. Additional post-processing analysis can be found in the Utility folder.
