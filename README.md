## Name
PyMEX: Python package for Moiré EXciton

## Description
We solved the Bethe-Salpeter Equation (BSE) for the exciton properties. The
software package is developed using mpi4py, numpy, scipy, cython, and h5py
libraries. 

This package helps you to compute moiré excitons with Wannier
functions as basis. You can also compute the excitons of 2D
materials accurately at a fraction of the conventional GW-BSE
approach.

## Installation
Tested on python3.8, 3.9, 3.11.
Requires  
 + numpy
 + scipy
 + matplotlib (optional)
 + cython
 + mpi4py
 + h5py-parallel

## Support

questions or have found any bugs.
